                <li>The materials on Coinflash's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Coinflash makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</li>

            <h3>4. Limitations</h3>
            
            <p>In no event shall Coinflash or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Coinflash's website, even if Coinflash or a Coinflash authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

            <p>The materials appearing on Coinflash's website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors.

            <h3>6. Links</h3>
            
            <p>Coinflash has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Coinflash of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.</p>
            
            <h3>7. Modifications</h3>

            <h3>9. Plaid and Coinbase Linkage</h3>
            <p>Coinflash does not store usernames or passwords in it’s database.  Coinflash uses best practices to securely store access tokens.   Coinflash only requests read permissions on transactions through Plaid to access credit/debit/banking card information.  Coinflash is not authorized to make purchases or transfer money through the credit card linkage with Plaid.  For Coinbase linkage, Coinflash requests read access for a user's accounts and wallets.  It does this so the user can choose which account to debit money from on the ‘Settings’ panel.  Coinflash also requests access to buy on behalf of a user so it can make purchases of cryptocurrency on the user’s behalf.  Coinflash request a limit of $5 per week to be transferred out of a user’s account.  Coinflash does this so it can charge the $1 a month use fee.  It is set for $5 and weekly in the case Coinflash decides to change the pricing structure or add new services.
            Only the last two months of credit/banking card transactions are kept in Coinflash's database.</p>
            
            <h3>10. Coinflash Fees</h2>

It describes what types of information we collect, how we use that information, and who we share that information with.</p>

Plaid does not operate those websites, products, or services - please always review the privacy practices of a company before deciding whether to provide any information to them.</p>
                        <h3 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h3>
                        <p>In general, we collect information in a number of ways, including (i) when a client or end-user provides it directly to us via the Website and/or Service, (ii) when we obtain end-user information through trusted third parties including financial institutions, (iii) through your continued access of the Service, including data passively collected through technology such as &quot;cookies&quot;. The types of information we collect and our use of that information will depend on whether you are a Website Visitor, Client, or End-User.</p>
                        <p>By signing up for the Service, whether directly on our site, with one of the third-party applications that uses our software, or by any other means, you consent to these terms. Some features of the Service allow you to provide content, including financial credentials and information, to the Service. All content submitted by you to the Service or collected on your behalf from a third-party (e.g., client) application or a financial institution (e.g., a bank) may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <h3 id="cookies-and-ip-addresses">Cookies and IP Addresses</h3>
                        <p>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Service, including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Service (e.g., what links you have clicked on). Generally, the Service automatically collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Service so that we can analyze and improve them. We may also receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer service.</p>
                        <p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Service through the Internet. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Service and may associate that information with your Account if you have one. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they
                        enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the
                        Service.  This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.</p>

                            <li>And for the other purposes referenced in the &quot;Sharing and Disclosure&quot; section below (such as, for the purposes of legal compliance).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 id="sharing-and-disclosure">Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
                        <p>Plaid does not sell or rent any personal information to marketers or third parties that have not been explicitly authorized (e.g., in the case of a client).</p>
                        <p>We may share your Personal Information with trusted third parties who are integral to the operation of our Website and the Service, including but not limited to financial institutions, payment processors, verification services and credit bureaus, as well as any third parties that you have directly authorized to receive your Personal Information. We may store your Personal Information in locations outside the direct control of Plaid, for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers.</p>
                        <p>If you authorize an application to access your Plaid account, you acknowledge that we may share financial information with the third party that provides the authorized application. The use of your information by such third party will be subject to their applicable privacy policy, which you should carefully review.</p>
                        <p>We may disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties if: (i) we are compelled to do so by subpoena, court order or other legal process, (ii) we must do so to comply with laws, statutes, rules or regulations, including credit card rules, (iii) we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our Terms of Use.</p>
                        <p>We will only disclose your Personal Information in response to such a request if we believe in good faith that doing so is necessary to comply with applicable law or a legal obligation to which we are bound. If we receive such a request, we will use reasonable efforts to give you prompt notice, so that you may contest it if you choose. We will not provide you such notice if we determine in good faith that either (a) we are not permitted to provide it under applicable law, or (b) that doing so would result in an imminent risk of death, serious physical injury or significant property loss or damage to Plaid or a third party. In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar events, certain information in our possession may be transferred to our successor or assign.</p>
                        <p>We may occasionally email you with information about offers or new services.

However, you will continue to receive certain email communications related to your account including information regarding transactions and your relationship with Plaid.</p>
                        <h3 id="protection-of-information">Protection of Information</h3>
                        <p>Although no data storage or transmission can be 100% secure, we take significant steps to protect user and account information to ensure that it is kept private. Plaid maintains strict administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States. Access to information is limited (through user and password credentials and software systems) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions.

Other safeguards include, but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files.</p>

                        <p>This Privacy Policy was last changed on the date set forth at the top of the policy. We&apos;re constantly trying to improve the Service, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on our website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. In addition, we will also edit the date at the top of this policy to reflect the date of the changes. Please note that if you&apos;ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven&apos;t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Service, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Service after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>
